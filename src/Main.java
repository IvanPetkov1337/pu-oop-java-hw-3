 * Honestly, missed 2nd homework so I didn't have the movement ready and I've already messed this code way too much so I just displayed the 2 turtles, unfortunately
 * I won't be able to just delete all of the existing code and starting over again. Hopefully next projects/homeworks won't be as connected as these 3
